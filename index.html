        I build digital experiences and tools to help harness collective intelligence. Currently, I’m focused on learning to make these applications more <span style="color:#5ff1d0">immersive</span>, <span style="color:#5ff1d0">beautiful</span>, and <span style="color:#5ff1d0">fun</span>.

            Hello! My name is <span style=color:white>Brad</span> and I enjoy building websites, applications, and immersive experiences. While I’ve always loved computers, my passion for coding is relatively new. I stumbled upon this new venture when a friend and I were trying to bring a concept to life. We were at the point where our ideas needed to be tested but there was no funding for the project. So I decided to learn to code. To my surprise, I loved it! 
            <br>
            <br>
 
            I began using <span style=color:#5ff1d0>The Odin Project</span>, <span style=color:#5ff1d0>Free Code Camp</span>, and <span style=color:#5ff1d0>Codecademy</span> as resources for this new chapter in my life. I decdided to leave my formal education and career in healthcare behind. Fast-forward to today and I am working at a software company getting a foundation of technical knowledge under my belt. I continue to refine my coding skills while building my passion project. I'v recently discovered that 3D content, animations, and micro-interactions are a source of joy.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

            <br>
            <br>
            I hope to start learning <span style="color:#61dafb">React</span>, <span style="color:#2d79c7">TypeScript</span>, and <span style="color:#db7a4d">D3</span> in the near future.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of coding I have strong interests in Braziilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), online-gaming, and spending time with my daughter.

        <p>
            My background is in healthcare, specifically in the critical care setting. I am used to a fast-paced, high stress environment with a lot of attention to detail. I provided nutrition and hydration for the sickest patients in the Columbus, Ohio area. 
            <br>
            <br>
            During my career I reached the top of my field and helped expand the social norms of what Registered Dietitians (RDs) are able to do. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I intend to utilize my 
            <span style="color:#5ff1d0">ability to work well on a team</span>, 
            <span style="color:#5ff1d0">effectively communicate</span>, and 
            <span style="color:#5ff1d0">deliver detailed work</span> that I've 
            <span style="color:white">refined over the last decade</span> in the software engineering space. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Within the last year I have since transitioned into the tech field. I am currently getting a solid foundation as a tech lead with a software company. I continue to work on my coding skills in my free time.
