        I build digital experiences and tools to help harness collective intelligence. Currently, I’m focused on making these applications more <span style="color:#5ff1d0">immersive</span>, <span style="color:#5ff1d0">beautiful</span>, and <span style="color:#5ff1d0">fun</span>.

        About
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Brad and I enjoy building websites, applications, and immersive experiences. While I’ve always loved computers, my passion for coding is relatively new. I stumbled upon this new venture when a friend and I were trying to bring a concept to life. We were at the point where our ideas needed to be tested but there was no finaial way to get it done. So I decided to learn to code. To my surprise, I loved it!
 
            I began using The Odin Project, Free Code Camp, and Codecademy as resources for this new chapter in my life. I decdided to leave my formal education and career in healthcare behind. Fast-forward to today, and I am working at a software company getting a foundation of technical knowledge under my belt. I continue to refine my coding skills while building my passion project. 

            Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, Three.js, D3
            I am choosing to specialize in animations, 3D content, and micro-interactions.

            Outside of coding I have strong interests in Braziilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), gaming, (FPS/MMORPGs), and spending time with my daughter.
